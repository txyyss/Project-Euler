-- The points P (x1, y1) and Q (x2, y2) are plotted at integer
-- co-ordinates and are joined to the origin, O(0,0), to form Î”OPQ.

-- There are exactly fourteen triangles containing a right angle that
-- can be formed when each co-ordinate lies between 0 and 2 inclusive;
-- that is, 0 <= x1, y1, x2, y2 <= 2.

-- Given that 0 <= x1, y1, x2, y2 <= 50, how many right triangles can
-- be formed?
