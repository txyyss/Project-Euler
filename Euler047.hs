-- The first two consecutive numbers to have two distinct prime
-- factors are:

-- 14 = 2 * 7
-- 15 = 3 * 5

-- The first three consecutive numbers to have three distinct prime
-- factors are:

-- 644 = 2Â² * 7 * 23
-- 645 = 3 * 5 * 43
-- 646 = 2 * 17 * 19.

-- Find the first four consecutive integers to have four distinct
-- primes factors. What is the first of these numbers?
